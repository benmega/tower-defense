Benefits: Efficient asset handling, reusability, and reduced memory usage by ensuring each asset is loaded only once.
InputManager:

Purpose: Handles player input, mapping physical inputs (keyboard, mouse, gamepad) to game actions.
Benefits: Easier to handle complex input schemes and rebindable controls, separates input processing from game logic.
AnimationManager:

Purpose: Manages animations for various entities in the game.
Benefits: Centralizes animation logic, making it easier to update or change animations across different game entities.
PhysicsEngine/CollisionManager:

Purpose: Handles the physics and collision detection in the game.
Benefits: Consolidates physics and collision logic, improves performance and accuracy, and makes it easier to modify or extend physics behavior.
AudioManager:

Purpose: Manages all audio-related functionality, including sound effects and music.
Benefits: Simplifies audio control, such as playing, pausing, and volume adjustments, and ensures efficient audio resource management.
UIManager/HUDManager:

Purpose: Manages the gameâ€™s user interface and Heads-Up Display (HUD).
Benefits: Centralized management of UI elements like menus, buttons, and status bars, leading to more organized code and easier UI updates.
AIManager:

Purpose: Manages artificial intelligence for non-player characters or game entities.
Benefits: Separates AI logic from entity behavior, making it easier to develop and scale complex AI routines.
SaveLoadManager:

Purpose: Manages saving and loading game states.
Benefits: Encapsulates the functionality for persistent data, making it easier to handle different save slots and data serialization.
EventManager:

Purpose: Manages events and communication between different parts of the game.
Benefits: Facilitates a more decoupled architecture where components can subscribe to and emit events without direct references.
